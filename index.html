            <h2>Overview: Technology and Paranormal Investigation</h2>     
            <p>
                Although we often think of ghost hunting as unscientific, the field of paranormal investigation has a close relationship with the history of technology. Ghost hunters have continually applied new technologies and sciences to their investigations giving us a unique perspective into our human connection to not-so-human objects. Today ghost hunters use many pieces of technology to track, measure, and understand the unseen, just as scientists do... though through far less empirical methods in most cases.

            <!--Added a fancy blockquote to help make my point-->
            <blockquote class="otro-blockquote">
                I think that ghosts have become the medium, so to speak, of how we approach and mediate our own relationship to technology. Through both antiquated or low grade or malfunctioning or misused technology, and also how we interpret new cutting edge technology as well.

                This webpage offers an overview of a few pieces of ghost hunting technology. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, if you are a skeptic or a believer, these technologies offer an interesting case study into how we as humans endeavor to see the unseeable and know the yet unknown.

            <h2>Technology descriptions</h2>
            <p>
                Most technologies used in paranormal investigation are items you'd have around the house including
                <ul>
                    <li>Flashlights</li>
                    <li>Audio recorders</li>
                    <li>Cameras and video cameras</li>
                    <li>Walkie talkies</li>
                    <li>Pens and notebooks</li>
                </ul>
                For investigators more invested in technology (or investigators chasing higher online view counts), specialized equipment exists that can collect different kinds of information while on site.

                       <p class="tabtext">Spirit boxes scan normal radio frequencies and present two options of communication to any entities in the area. First, ghosts are said to use the frequencies to choose particular sounds or words that are coming through the radio. Alternatively, ghosts may manipulate the frequencies to generate their own messages. These boxes come in many shapes and sizes but often look like a small handheld radio.</p>

                  Typically used in home appliance maintenance, EMF (electromagnetic frequency) detectors can be a useful tool for ghost hunting. Spikes in EMF activity are often attributed to paranormal activity and may be used to collect enviornmental information during an investigation.

                    This camera was originally introduced as a video game technology in devices such as the Xbox Kinect. The camera is able to detect humanoid figures by putting out thousands of small points of light that get interrupted to form a picutre. Many investigators, espeically those famous online and on TV, use this device to show more visual evidence of ghosts.

              <p class="tabtext">
                Finally, and my personal favorite, is the Ovilus. This device collects information about temperature and magnetic fields to select words from a pre-set library. The theory is that paranormal entities can manipulate these enviornmental features to intentionally choose words from the library. Who decides the words in this library? Can a ghost actually "talk" through these means? Who's to say.
